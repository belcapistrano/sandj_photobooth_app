## Technical Implementation Details

### Encryption Technologies Used

1. **iOS Data Protection**
   ```swift
   // Standard iOS file protection
   FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: path, contents: data,
       attributes: [.protectionKey: FileProtectionType.complete])
   ```
   - **Type**: Standard iOS file system encryption
   - **Purpose**: Protect locally stored photos
   - **Classification**: Exempt under Category 5 Part 2

2. **iOS Secure Enclave (if applicable)**
   ```swift
   // Standard iOS security framework usage
   import LocalAuthentication
   // Uses device biometric security
   ```
   - **Type**: Standard iOS biometric encryption
   - **Purpose**: NOT USED in this app
   - **Classification**: N/A

3. **Standard iOS APIs Only**
   ```swift
   import UIKit
   import AVFoundation
   import Photos
   import CoreImage
   ```
   - **Custom encryption libraries**: NONE
   - **Third-party crypto**: NONE
   - **Network encryption**: NOT APPLICABLE (offline app)
